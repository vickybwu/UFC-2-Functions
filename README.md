# UFC-2-Functions

## This project is done with the same data I used in UFC-1-App. Instead of an app, this project contains purely functions:
- get_fight_stats("fistname","lastname") Type in any fighter name to get the fighter's stats 
- get_fight_chart("firstnae","lastname") Type in any fighter name to get a pie chart of the fighter's history scores and a text message of how many fights and strikes the fighter had so far. 
- get_bar_chart("firstname", "lastname") Type in any fighter name to get a barchart of the fighter's history scores
- get_strike_accuracy("firstname","lastname") Type in any fighter name to view the fighter's strike accuracy in a pie chart
- get_takedown_accuracy("firsyname","lastname") Type in any fighter name to view the fighter's take down accuracy in a pie chart
- number_of_fights("field name",a number) Type in any varibale/field name (ie: Strikes) and a number N to view the N top ranked fighters by that variable
